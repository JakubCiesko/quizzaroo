# Quizzaroo
Welcome to Quizzaroo! This Python Tkinter application allows you to create quiz questions using the OpenAI API. I developed this app to help prepare for university tests by generating quiz questions from input text, ensuring a thorough understanding of the material.

## Features
- Generate Quiz Questions: Input text and get quiz questions generated using the OpenAI API.
- Highlighting: Highlight parts of the text that you want the quiz to focus on.
- Future Plans:
    - Massive code refactoring
  - Summary Upload: Upload your summaries of the text and let the app evaluate their adherence to the original text (not yet implemented).
  - Audio Upload: Record yourself summarizing the text and upload the audio for analysis (not yet implemented).

## Usage
- Launch the application.
- Input the text from which you want to generate quiz questions.
- Highlight the parts of the text you want the quiz to focus on.
- Click the "Generate Questions" button to create quiz questions using the OpenAI API.
- Review and test your knowledge with the generated quiz questions.
